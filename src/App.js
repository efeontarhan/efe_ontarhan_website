        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm currently writing my master‚Äôs thesis in Technology and Engineering Management at Universitat Rovira i Virgili.
          My academic background started in Civil Engineering at METU (ODT√ú), but my interest quickly shifted to the intersection
          of business and technology. I'm passionate about sales, operations, and strategic growth ‚Äî especially in environments
          where innovation and human-centered thinking matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've gained hands-on experience through internships at Beymen Group and INCO International. At Beymen, I analyzed KPI data,
          prepared internal reports, and supported communication between stores and headquarters. At INCO, I worked on procurement
          and supply chain process improvements in Dubai, where I also negotiated with suppliers and optimized inventory strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          These experiences reflect not only my analytical mindset but also my emotional intelligence ‚Äî I work well with people,
          listen carefully, and stay calm in moments of pressure. I enjoy finding common ground and creating harmony within teams.
